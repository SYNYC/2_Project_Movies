# Module 2 : Regression

This is my 2nd project in Metis bootcamp. We are learning Regression on this module. I also web-scrapped Box Office Mojo website to collect the data. The goal of this project is to predict if a new movie will realize the high lifetime domestic gross based on its profile, and I intended to use linear regression to solve this problem.
